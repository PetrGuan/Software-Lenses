# Contributing

Thanks for helping improve Software Analysis Mindsets.

## Workflow

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a feature branch from `main`.
3. Make focused changes with clear commits.
4. Open a pull request against `main`.

Example:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Software-Analyze-Philosphy.git
cd Software-Analyze-Philosphy
git checkout -b feat/add-lovelace-mindset
```

## What to Contribute

- Add new analysis mindsets under the correct topic folder (`architecture/`, `debugging/`, `performance/`, `strategy/`, `testing/`).
- Improve existing mindset files for clarity, accuracy, and practical usefulness.
- Fix broken links, formatting issues, and inconsistencies between command files and docs.

## Content Guidelines

- Keep writing concrete and actionable.
- Use examples tied to real engineering scenarios.
- Keep terminology consistent with existing mindset files.
- Prefer small, reviewable pull requests over large rewrites.

## Source of Truth and Command Format

To avoid duplication:

- Canonical mindset content lives in topic folders:
	- `architecture/*.md`
	- `debugging/*.md`
	- `performance/*.md`
	- `strategy/*.md`
	- `testing/*.md`
- `.claude/commands/*.md` are lightweight wrappers that route to the canonical files.

Command wrapper structure:

```md
---
description: "Short explanation of when to use this command"
argument-hint: "[file, function, or module to analyze]"
---

# [Mindset] Analysis

Canonical mindset spec: `category/mindset.md`.

Read that file first, then apply it to `$ARGUMENTS`.
```

Recommended conventions:

- Update the canonical file first.
- Keep wrappers short and stable.
- Ensure wrapper path points to the correct canonical file.
- Keep `description` and `argument-hint` clear and concrete.

## Pull Request Expectations

Before opening a PR, confirm:

- Markdown renders correctly.
- Internal links resolve.
- Added or updated mindset files are reflected in `README.md` when relevant.
- CI checks pass.

## Reporting Issues

Use GitHub issue templates for:

- Bug reports (broken links, formatting, or command behavior)
- New mindset proposals
